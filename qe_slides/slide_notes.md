Time 3:42 is boring -> we want to see a slide showing history?

try to give fewer points for each slides and add more graphs

For time: 2:45, put a slide just talking how important is ASR in terms of $$$, and latest trend of openAI for ASR “Whisper” -> telling the audience that this research area is still active and important
Also mentioned that it has been active from 19??0s -> now?

In 3:21, when you talk about DNN, you can use the important paper the 4 tech giant view of DNN for ASR? Hinton’s paper?

I will shorten the introduction part

no hand waving
