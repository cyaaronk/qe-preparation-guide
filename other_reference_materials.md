# Another example of nice overview:  John Dennis thesis that’s useful for your thesis writing:

 

In John’s thesis, there are several notable figures, tables, etc that help the reader to be quickly briefed of the works at hand: see

    Taxonomy of the type of audio involved: Fig 2.3 and Table 2.1
    Challenges of the problem Table 2.2

# Some suggestions to improve your QE

 

Topic: How to write a Lit review as a chapter of your thesis.

Motivation: this chapter should

        summarize works related to approaches, solutions, state of the art.
        corpus available, how to measure performance,
        existing problem unsolved problems

Review papers provide nice writeup with similar objective, I will use the following paper as a reference, pls download https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09624.pdf,
Park et al, “A Review of Speaker Diarization: Recent Advances with Deep Learning”, 2021 arvix.

In the above paper, I see that it has:

    Its arrangements should have nice figures, tables, etc to show the complex relationships:
        Fig 1 summarizes problem at hand
        Table 1 breaks down the taxonomy (this depends on your work if its needed or not
    Table of methods : table 2  quickly summarizes what are approaches, its breakdown due to classes of techniques, and where it is discussed in the thesis, names of the approaches as well as its names
    Table of corpus: table 3 -> normally we want this so that it’s a breeze to see whats available (but we want it as a section and you have to describe it like in section 5)
    Description of cost function – see sec 1.4 (you must always tell us how to measure performance)
    Use diagrams to illustrate your model:

    Fig 3 shows input->output of x-vector system
    fig 5 shows a nice overview of spectra clustering and the maths involved
