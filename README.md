# What is this repo about? Who is the audience?
This repo documents the process of my preparation for SCSE QE report and presention. The refinement of the documents are recorded by their version number, so you can see how my preparation has been improved over time to come to the final version.

This repo is best suited for SCSE graduate students who are about to do their qualifying examination (QE) and want to know how one should approach and prepare for it. Graduate students from other disciplines are also welcomed although the format and requirement for their QE may be different from the one shown here.

# Why do you need to learn about preparation for QE report and presentation?
The preparation is for you to speed up and produce high quality QE report and slides.
1. QE reports can be up to 100 pages long. Without a good organization of what to write and how much to write will make you waste time in writing unnessary content and a hard time coming up with the next paragraph.
2. QE presentation needs to be extremely clear and concise. Therefore the slides to prepare should follow a specific style and structure for good presentation. It is not ordinary slides that you would expect to to make for your undergrad. 

# Where should you start?
First go and look at the Content section below. You can follow along to do your own QE preparation as you read through.

## Content
How I prepared for my presentation and report for my SCSE QE

#### a) QE Questions
The first thing I did was to have a look at ```other_reference_materials.md```. This give me a basic idea of what a QE report and presentation looks like. My QE report and slides should look VERY similar to theirs.

Then, I proceeded to draft a list of QE questions to be answered in my QE report in ```qe_question_list/question_list_v2.txt```.

The below are some tips for writing the question list:
1. Check out the slides in ```qe_question_list/QE Preparation.pptx``` to understand how to structure your questions and what questions to write for each section of your QE report.
2. Write questions in a cascaded format. Use Sublime or any text editor that can hide/collide subsections inside sections. Otherwise the number of questions shown in the editor will explode and quickly become unmanageable.
3. Mark down the number of pages you plan to write in your QE report for each question. Sum them up to see if they exceed the page limit.
4. Write more questions starting with WHY and HOW. For Lit review, write questions more about Comparison between techniques. (main difference between ```question_list_v2.txt``` and ```question_list.txt```)

#### b) Slides
After writing the list of QE questions, prepare slides to answer them.
The slides will be used as part of the content in your QE report. It is also used for your QE presentation.
Check out ```qe_slides/andrew_qe_presentation_timing.txt``` to understand the structure of the slides and how much time you should spend on each section.

Then, I preceeded to draft the slides in ```qe_slides/qe_presentation_v*.pptx```. Notice the huge difference between ```qe_slides/qe_presentation_v2.pptx``` and ```qe_slides/qe_presentation_v4.pptx```. The former is a failure example and should be avoided.

The below are some tips for writing the slides:
1. You don't need to answer all the QE quetions in the slides. Put main focus on the contributions. Your introduction section of the slides should be very brief and cover also a very brief Lit review.
2. Slide should always be graphical and understandable from a glance.
3. Try to only write 1 summary sentence in point form for each slide. The details of the slide should be explained/said by yourself.
4. Put 1 slide showing the outline before starting a new section. The slide does not just provide a summary of the previous few slides, but also acted a 'breather' for the minds of those listening.
5. Provide graphs in place of tables for experimental results, and color schemes to make results more intuitive


#### c) Report
After preparing the QE questions and slides, you can start writing your QE report. You will find that this part is the easiest and fastest to complete if you have done all the preparations.

An example of my QE report is in ```qe_report.pdf```. A rule of thumb about the QE structure is that each point in your abstract section should be expanded in the intro section. Each claim about previous works in the intro section should expanded in the lit review section. A word is expanded to a sentence, a sentence is expanded to a paragraph, a paragraph is expanded to a subsection/section.

I draft the report by answering each QE question as a paragraph. If a slide is also prepared for a specific question, use the points to draft the paragraph and add information, evidence, citations. Also put the figures you make in the slides into the QE report.

You should avoid the following as you write the QE report:
1. Imprecise word
2. Redundant/not concise wording
3. Lack of figures
4. Lack of correctness
5. Lack of logical flow

#### d) Presentation

For 40 minutes QE presentation, control your time to about 30 minutes. Practice and put notes for each slide in somewhere only you can see.

Below are something you want to avoid for you presentation:
1. lack of logical flow
2. Did not provide all necessary info to reader
3. Provide redundancy info
4. Lack of correctness
5. Lack of figures
6. Use of imprecise word

#### e) After finishing QE
This section is not about preparation of QE but what to do after QE. I included it here as I think it will be usefull to the readers also.

First, try to reflect on what you have wrong during QE and you can avoid them in your final PhD thesis defense. 

Then, if you present clearly during your QE presentation, the QE panel will usually give you very useful feedback and question about the weakness they found in your presentation/research. This is extremely helpful for you to make plans for your research after QE.

The below are my research weakness that I found by listening to the feedback from QE panel:
1. Lack of SotA baselines
2. Lack of in-depth analysis to reasons of improvements

## Acknowledgements
I would like to express my gratitude to Prof Chng Eng Siong, my supervisor, who helped me through revising my report and presentations through multiple iterations. Prof Chng's feedback was useful in pointing out gaps in both my presentation and content flow. His expertise allowed me to succinctly deliver my content without over-elaborating on certain points.
